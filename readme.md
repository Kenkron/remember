Remember
========

Description:
------------

This program is designed to help you remember things.  To do this, start by telling the program how things are.  Use the words `is` and `are` to say things like `Ron's number is 555-6666` or `smurfs are blue people`.  Then, when you are done, ask who or what questions like `what is my phone number?` or `who are the smurfs?`.  If you have explained the things you asked for already, the program will recite what it remembers.

You may also wish to be reminded of things.  To do this, use `remind me` as in `remind me to leave` or `remind me to do the thing`.  Later, when you open this script again, your reminders will be shown to you.  Your reminders are stored just like any other thing under the label `my reminders`. Thus, you may view, add to, and forget your reminders just like anything else.

If you can't remember what it is you are trying to remember, and want to see a big long list of all the facts your program has, `ls` will list everything it knows.
